### CommRad (CommentsRadar)
Fetches new comments from a YouTube channel and sends them to Discord. Originally created in March-April 2024 as part of practicing Node.js and programming in general. Ideally, it should be rewritten in TypeScript and follow best practices, but I currently lack the time and motivation to do so.
